SUMMARY:

Brucify is tool for taking a Film Critic Hulk post [1] and converting the text
to a more pleasant visual experience.

USAGE:

Copy the ALL-CAPS text from any Film Critic Hulk post to a file (say:
hulk.txt).  You may then run:

  ./brucify.rb hulk.txt > bruce.txt

to produce a less tempermental version of the original post.

DETAILS:

The script is embarassingly simplistic.  It replaces all the uppercase words
with lowercase.  It then tries to recognize when a word is the first word of a
sentence and capitalizes it appropriately.  All references to "HULK" are
replaced with "Bruce".

The reason I chose to keep the text in the third person is that figuring out
when to convert "HULK" to "I" or "me" and then conjugating "has" to "have" or
"is" to "am", etc. would have taken much too long for anything less than a
master's thesis in NLP.  (But YOU, dear reader, are more than welcome to fork
this repo, and I will welcome any improvments with open arms.)
